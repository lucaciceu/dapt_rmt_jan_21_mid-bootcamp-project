The repository has the following:
- the csv file with the data
- the sql file with the sql analysis
- the final presentation in tableau
- the 3 files with the steps we took to perfect the model ("third try" is the first, final simplified model is the "finished" product)
- the Python file with the automated model (we used one made by Felipe "Teach" Rocha) as the benchmark for our model evaluations
